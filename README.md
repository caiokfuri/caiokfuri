### Hey! What's up? <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643514688/6905/blob_salute.png?1643514688" width="22" />

I'm <a href="https://github.com/CaioK367"><strong>Caio</strong></a> (or Kfuri to friends), a software engineer based in Brazil.

**If I can think of it, I'll find a way to engineer it.**

I'm building a strong background in the **Java ecosystem (Spring Boot)** and **C++**. On the frontend, I'm currently expanding my skills with **React**.

I'm deeply interested in **Software Architecture** and **Hardware**. Currently, I'm diving into **low-level computing**, bridging the gap between software and the physical world.

My main tech stack is Java/Spring Boot and C++. My favorite tools are **Docker**, **Insomnia**, and **Concepts** (for sketching ideas on my tablet).

**Fun Facts:**

* ⚔️ **Gamer:** I love shooters, story-driven games, and roguelites.
* 🎃 **Holiday:** My favorite holiday is Halloween.
* 👻 **TV:** Big fan of the Supernatural series.
* 🖥️ **Hardware:** I enjoy building and tweaking my own PC rigs.
* 🐧 **Explorer:** I run a dual-boot setup (Windows & Linux) to get the best of both worlds.
